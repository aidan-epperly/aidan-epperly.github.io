Hi, my name is Aidan Epperly: applied math student and math researcher! I am currently researching a mathematical object called a free spectrahedron, which is an object of increasing importance in the fields of quantum information theory, convex optimization, and mathematical control. My passions include numerical methods, linear algebra, graph theory, and optimization.
